# NetScience

There is a good and short review for me to revise three important packages related to **Network Science** in **Python** and **R**, including **networkx**, **igraph**, and **pathpy**. 

Besides, it is a good cohesion to integrate different sources for **further teaching** issues.

At least, I will list all basic tutorials and things related to spatial analysis, and even GeoAI.
